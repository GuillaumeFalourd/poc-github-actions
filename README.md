## Workflow YAML Basic Structure Explanation

```bash
name: Github action workflow name

on:
  push: # Run this workflow every time a new commit pushed to the repository
  pull_request:  # Run this workflow every time a new pull request is opened to the repository
  scheduled: # Run this workflow as a cron job
    - cron: "0 0 * * MON-FRI"
  workflow_dispatch: # Run this workflow on demand (manually)

jobs: # All workflows need at list one job

  job-key: #First job
    name: Job Name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Set the type of machine the workflow will run on
    steps: # Each job can be divided in many steps

      - name: Checkout code # Step name
        uses: actions/checkout@v2 # Action used on the step

      - name: Run Super-Linter # Another step name
        uses: github/super-linter@v3  # Action used on the step
        env:  # Environment variables used on the step
          DEFAULT_BRANCH: main
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Run specific commands # Another step name
        run: |
          ls -lha
          echo "This is a shell command"

```
